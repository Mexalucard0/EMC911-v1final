# 24/12/2019

Added money and weapons to the loot table.
Examples are in the config.lua, under the 'entertainment unit' table (for a loot stash that uses weapons, items and money as a reward),
and the 'drawers' table (for a loot stash that outputs absolutely nothing... just an example).
Make sure you set the proper 'RewardAccount' (in the main config table) to your desired account. 

NOTES: If for some reason, your players aren't getting the correct amount of ammo on receiving a gun (e.g: receiving 250 bullets every time instead of random would be the "incorrect amount"),
your ESX is heavily outdated. Update that to fix the issue.

Fixed ped spawning outside after being killed inside. Duplicate event was the cause of this.
Added percentage chance for dog spawn in config.lua. NOTE: Only effects houses that dogs are actually going to spawn at, not ALL houses.
